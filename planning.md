All bullet points below are things required for the App Academy Open "Building your First Website" project. My own notes are in [].

Home page:
    ✓ -Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
    ✓ -1 header using H1 [will have an H1 on every page just for consistency]
    ✓ -3 sections of text with H2 headers ["Intro", "Why did I start this?", "Themes"]
    ✓ -1 image [a selection from my Backloggery page]

"My Favorite Games" page:
    ✓ -Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
    ✓ -1 header using H1
    ✓ -6 images displayed 3 wide and 2 down [I would prefer them to be by the text, but the project mandates this...]
        ✓ -A label for each image [I would also prefer these to be alt text or something non-intrusive, but again, project mandates]
        ✓ -Clicking on the image opens the source of that image in a new window [probably will use Steam links whenever possible, or things like VGChartz for console games]


"Your Favorite Games" page:
    ✓ -Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
    ✓ -HTML form with a minimum of:
        ✓ -1 fieldset
        ✓ -3 inputs
            ✓ -2 text ["What's your favorite game you've played this year?" and "What's your favorite game of all time?"]
            ✓ -1 checkbox ["Would you call yourself a 'gamer'?"]
        ✓ -1 textarea ["What games are you looking forward to playing this year?"]
        ✓ -Appropriate labels for the above
        ✓ -1 button

"Links" page:
    ✓ -Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
    ✓ -1 header using H1
    ✓ -1 ordered or unordered list of links to 5 other websites [Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Xbox Game Pass, Backloggery. will probably have non-link text describing these links]
