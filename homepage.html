            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Intro</h2>

            <p>This is a simple website to show the highlights of my video game clearing adventures. I started keeping track of my game clears in 2021 and have been doing so ever since. I occasionally pick "themes" to work from to keep it interesting and encourage myself to try new things.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Why did you start doing this?</h2>

            <p>To be frank, I have way too many video games. As of 03/05/24, my Backloggery (a website for keeping track of these things) sits at 2815 games, and I know that's not entirely up to date. While I have no illusions that I'll ever play every single game I own, I wanted to cut into that backlog just a bit, and hopefully find some new favorites along the way.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">What is wrong with you?</h2>

            <p id="homepage-snark">I wish I knew. &#128578;</p>
            <p>More seriously, I blame Humble Bundle. When my options are "buy a Steam game I want for $15 on sale" or "buy a bundle with the same game plus 8 others for $10," I know which I'm picking. itch.io is another culprit, thanks to the "200+ games for $5" bundles they've done for charity over the years.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">What themes have you done?</h2>

            <ul id="homepage-list">
                <li>2021: <i>Alphabet Clearing</i> (a game starting with each letter from A to Z) and <i>Critical Darlings</i> (games with overwhelmingly positive reviews)</li>
                <li>2022: <i>Xbox Xtravaganza</i> (Xbox Game Pass games) and <i>Back in the Day</i> (games I played, but didn't finish, in the past)</li>
                <li>2023: <i>Stop Procrastinating</i> (games I've meant to try for months/years) and <i>Zeldathon</i> (playing through the old The Legend of Zelda games)</li>
                <li>2024: <i>All Hands on Deck</i> (games that work well on Steam Deck) and <i>Astrological Activities</i> (games that somehow tie into one of the twelve Chinese Zodiac animals; may extend to other astrology if there's time)</li>
            </ul>
